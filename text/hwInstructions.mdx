The Auction App enables a number of transactions. If you are a HW Wallet user, you have to approve the input for each transaction. That input includes the Method ID of the method being called, the parameters for the method and the address of the contract being called.

In the following you can see the addresses of the MCD mainnet contracts being called and the Method ID of the function (or selector) being called. You can use this as one source of verification that you actually are calling the correct contracts with your HW Wallet.
